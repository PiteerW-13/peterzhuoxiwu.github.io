    <h2>Act 1.2 - The Diversity of the Earth's Outer Spheres</h2>
    <img src="../../assets/images/PETE_1.2.jpg" class="portrait" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <b style="font-size: larger;">After</b> understanding the inner layers of the earth, we decided to start observing the outer 
layers, so PETE controlled the spacecraft. As the soil outside the cabin slowly 
loosened, the spacecraft began to climb upwards. As the energy released by the 
spacecraft increased; the speed of the spacecraft also increased until it stopped on the 
surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        After reaching the surface, PETE immediately began his explanation work.</p>
    <p> "Sir, do you know which outer layers are included?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I curled my lips confidently and answered: "This is not simple, it's just the atmosphere, 
hydrosphere and biosphere, what's so difficult about this!" 
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, your answer is not rigorous, there is also a lithosphere!" PETE immediately 
refuted.
    </p>
    <p>
        I frowned and was puzzled by his rejoinder: "Doesn't the lithosphere belong 
to the inner layers?"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE shook his head and added: "In fact, the lithosphere is a layer between the inner and 
outer layers, which is transitional, including the top of the crust and the upper mantle, that 
is, the solid rock part above the asthenosphere."
    </p>
    <p>
        Then let's talk about other spheres:
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Atmosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The atmosphere is the gaseous envelope outside the Earth. It is the frontier for the 
exchange of matter between the Earth and the universe. According to the temperature 
changes of the atmosphere at different altitudes, it is usually divided into 5 layers (the 
specific content will be explained in the next section). The atmosphere is composed of 
gaseous substances surrounding the outermost part of the Earth. It is an indispensable 
material condition for the survival of humans and organisms. It is also a protective layer 
that keeps the surface temperature and moisture constant. Besides, it is an important driving 
force and medium for promoting changes in the surface morphology.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Hydrosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The hydrosphere is a generally continuous layer covering the surface of the earth 
composed of liquid water and solid water on the Earth's oceans and land. Its main body is 
the <b>ocean</b>, followed by surface water, groundwater, and water in the atmosphere. Under 
the influence of <b>solar radiation</b>, water circulation is constantly carried out. The <b>water 
cycle</b> not only regulates the climate and purifies the air, but also plays a very important role 
in material migration and energy conversion on the surface of the Earth (such as water 
scouring and dissolution)
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Biosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The biosphere is the general term for all organisms on the Earth and their living 
environment. It does not occupy any space alone but is composed of gaseous substances 
on the outermost surface of the Earth that penetrate the hydrosphere, the lower layer of the 
atmosphere, and the lithosphere. It is an indispensable material condition for the survival 
of humans and organisms and is also a protective layer that keeps the surface at a 
constant temperature and moisture. It is also an important driving force and medium for 
promoting changes in the surface morphology.
    </p>
    <p>
        After listening to PETE’s introduction to the Earth's outer layer, I also gained a deeper 
understanding of the Earth. At the same time, I began to look forward to the next stop, and 
hurriedly asked him, "PETE, where are we going next?"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE, like a calm and composed middle-aged man, rejoindered slowly: "Sir, I believe you 
will look forward to the next stop, because the next stop is to understand the Earth's 
atmosphere, which means we are ready to leave the Earth and explore other planets!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Really?" I was so excited that I almost jumped up, "How long will we observe this time? I 
really hope to explore other planets as soon as possible!"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE still answered slowly: "The importance of the atmosphere to the Earth is self-evident, 
so this time we may spend more time studying the atmosphere than the previous stops. I 
hope you can understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I scratched my head, smiled, and said, "It's okay. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to 
explore the universe." </p>
    <p> "Now the important thing is to quickly complete the observation of the 
next stop. Let's set off immediately!"
