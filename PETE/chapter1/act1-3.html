    <h2>Act 1.3 - The Atmosphere, really "Atmospheric"!</h2>
    <img src="../../assets/images/PETE_1.3.jpg" class="portrait" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">

    <p><mark style="color: darkorange; font-size: x-large;"><i><b>Part I</b></i></mark></p>
    <p>
        <b style="font-size: larger;">"Let's go!"</b> </p>
    <p>As I gave the order, the spacecraft seemed to follow my order, automatically locked the 
destination, and immediately charged. With a "whoosh", like a bullet just out of the gun, it 
moved forward toward the locked target. After a while, we were already 10km above the 
surface.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Then we are ready to start!" PETE said.</p>
    <p> "At this stop, we mainly study the structural 
characteristics and functions of the atmosphere. I will explain it in two parts, please listen 
carefully!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Okay, I'm ready, let's get started!" I replied impatiently. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As usual, PETE showed me a picture and asked: "Sir, where do you think the layers of 
clouds in this picture are located in the atmosphere?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "That's babywork! Isn't it the first layer of the atmosphere - the troposphere? Our teacher has 
taught us about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yes, sir, you are right this time. Let me start with a brief explanation: We all know that 
according to the <b>temperature changes at different altitudes</b>, the atmosphere can be 
divided into five layers - the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere 
(ionosphere), and exosphere."
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Troposphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        It is the layer of the atmosphere closest to the earth's surface and the lowest layer of the 
atmosphere. The troposphere is affected by different terrains (such as forests, lakes, 
mountains, etc.), and the temperature changes are caused by sunlight, which causes 
vertical and horizontal winds, that is, a large amount of air convection occurs, so it is 
called the troposphere. Its height varies with latitude. The average height in low-latitude 
areas is 17~18 kilometers, the average height in mid-latitude areas is 10~12 kilometers, 
and the average height in the polar regions is 8~9 kilometers. Since this layer is the lowest 
layer of the atmosphere, it has the highest density and contains almost 75% of the total 
atmospheric mass. Therefore, the air can flow up and down in the troposphere, and 
weather phenomena such as wind, rain, thunder, and lightning occur in this layer.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Stratosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The stratosphere includes the stratosphere, inversion layer, and ozone layer. The layer from 
the top of the troposphere to an altitude of 50~55 KM is called the stratosphere. From the 
top of the troposphere to 35~40 The layer around KM, where the temperature hardly 
changes with altitude, is the stratosphere. From this layer to the top of the stratosphere, the 
temperature increases with altitude, which is the inversion layer. The stratosphere 
concentrates most of the ozone (O3) in the atmosphere and reaches its maximum value at 
an altitude of 20-25 KM, which is the ozone layer. The stratosphere contains ozone, which 
can absorb ultraviolet rays to protect the survival of all organisms on the earth and the 
surface from the deadly invasion of strong ultraviolet rays in the sun. Because the 
stratosphere is <b>hot in the upper part and cold in the lower part, the advection 
movement is significant, and the atmosphere is stable without clouds and rain</b>, it is 
suitable for aviation.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Mesosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        It refers to the atmospheric layer from the top of the stratosphere to 85 kilometers. 
Since a low amount of ozone content in this layer, it cannot absorb a large number of 
solar ultraviolet rays, and most of the short-wave radiation that nitrogen and oxygen can 
absorb is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, so the temperature <b>decreases with 
increasing altitude</b>. Because the upper part of this layer of atmosphere is cold and the 
the lower part is warm, the air produces <b>convection movement</b>. However, due to the thin 
air in this layer, its convection movement cannot be compared with that of the troposphere. 
There are also many interesting phenomena in the mesosphere: noctilucent clouds appear 
at high latitudes, in summer, and at dusk, and abnormal weather in summer and winter, 
etc.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Thermosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        It is located above the mesosphere and below the exosphere, and its top is about 800km 
from the ground. since the air in the thermosphere is <b>highly ionized</b> by the short-wave 
radiation from the sun, the ionosphere exists in this layer. In the thermosphere, the 
<b>temperature rises rapidly with increasing altitude</b>. This is because the ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun is absorbed by the atmospheric substances in this layer. The degree 
of warming is related to solar <b>activity</b>. When solar activity intensifies, the temperature 
rises rapidly with increasing altitude; conversely, when solar activity weakens, the 
temperature rises slowly with increasing altitude. Among them, there is also the aurora 
phenomenon that we are familiar with - electrons accelerated by the magnetic field in <b>high 
latitudes</b> will flow in, collide with atmospheric molecules in the thermosphere, and then 
be ionized. When those molecules return to their original state, they will produce a 
luminous phenomenon, which is called <b>aurora</b>.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Exosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        It is the atmospheric layer above the thermosphere and the outermost layer of the Earth's 
atmosphere. The lower boundary of the exosphere is more than 800km from the surface, 
and the top boundary is about 2000-3000km in height. The temperature of the exosphere is 
extremely high, and the temperature is vertically distributed from low to high, and it 
increases with increasing altitude. Here, atmospheric molecules are heated because they 
absorb <b>short-wave radiation</b> from the sun. But because the atmospheric density of the 
exosphere is too low, it will not make people feel any warmth. Similar to the thermosphere, 
most of the molecules in this layer of air are ionized at the same time under the action of 
solar ultraviolet rays and cosmic rays. The air in the exosphere is extremely thin, and its 
density is almost the same as that of space, so it is also called the outer atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        "This is the structure and characteristics of the five layers of the atmosphere, sir. Do you 
have any questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "I don't understand anything, but I remember that the teacher talked about the upper 
atmosphere in class. Why didn't you mention it when you introduced the five layers of the 
atmosphere just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, it seems that you have overlooked the premise I mentioned just now - temperature 
changes at different altitudes. This is only one of the conditions for analyzing the layers of 
the atmosphere. Of course, there are two other conditions:
    </p>
    <p><b style="font-size: larger;"><u> ① The distribution characteristics of atmospheric components with altitude</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is divided into a <b>uniform layer</b> and a <b>non-uniform layer</b>.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">The uniform layer</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        This refers to the space from the ground to about 80 kilometers. 
        Due to the mixing effects of convection, turbulence, etc. caused by the <b>uneven distribution</b> of atmospheric temperature,
        air pressure, and number density, the volume percentage of each component of the atmosphere remains unchanged
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">The non-uniform layer</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        Refers to the atmospheric area above about 80 kilometers. Here, the volume percentage of different atmospheric components varies with altitude.
    </p>
    <p><b style="font-size: larger;"><u> ② The ionization characteristics of the atmosphere</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is then divided into <b>inosphere</b> and <b>neutral layer</b>.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Ionosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        Focusing on the ionosphere, it is mainly affected by the ionization of neutral atoms and air 
molecules by radiation outside the Earth (mainly solar radiation). The area above 60km 
above the surface is in a partially or fully ionized state. The ionosphere is a partially ionized 
atmospheric region; the fully ionized atmospheric region is called the magnetosphere. Of 
course, the magnetosphere can also be classified as part of the ionosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sir, by the way, in addition to the Earth, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter also have ionospheres!”
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Neutral Layer</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The neutral layer refers to the atmospheric layer from the ground to an altitude of about 60 
kilometers. It is mainly composed of neutral gases. The atmosphere in the layer may 
sometimes have more charged particles in some parts (such as during thunderstorms), but 
generally, there are fewer charged particles.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Let's talk about your question."
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Upper atmosphere</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The upper atmosphere structure is composed of the ionosphere, an inhomogeneous layer, 
homogeneous layer, exosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere. It refers to the area where 
The Earth’s atmosphere begins to ionize (i.e., above 60km above the surface). Similar to the 
ionosphere, people also have different views on the starting height of the upper 
atmosphere: Some believe that the lower limit of the upper atmosphere is about 30km 
above the surface, while others believe that the upper atmosphere is above the top of the 
mesosphere (85km above the surface). In addition, due to the solar radiation of the upper 
atmosphere, the atmospheric temperature above about 80 kilometers increases with the 
increase in altitude; at the same time, the particles in the upper atmosphere are very fast, 
and it is possible for them to overcome the gravitational pull of the Earth and escape from 
The Earth's atmosphere and gas particles in space may also enter the upper atmosphere. 
As a result, the air in the upper atmosphere is extremely thin, which can be said to be 
thinner than an artificial vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sir, I have basically outlined the structure and characteristics of the atmosphere. I hope 
you can understand the principle!” 
    </p>
    <p>
        “Great, I will continue to study and analyze it. Then let's move on to the second part! "I can't 
wait to say, I can't hold back my joy.”
    </p>
    <p>
        But this time, PETE is like a sophisticated old man, "Sir, I have to advise you, don't press yourself that hard! I understand your excitement and your love for this kind of thing, but 
everything needs to be done slowly, digested, and analyzed step by step to solve the 
problem more efficiently! Sir, I hope you can understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I felt a little disappointed and could only look out the window blankly, as if those colorful 
clouds could hold my hope, and send it to the long night far away with the approaching 
dusk...
    </p>
    <p><mark style="color: darkorange; font-size: x-large;"><i><b>Part II</b></i></mark></p>
    <p>
        "Sir, please get up, we have other plans today!" 
    </p>
    <p>
        The magnetic voice sounded again. When I heard that there were other plans, I also broke free from the dream that seemed real and 
fake. When I washed and had my meal, PETE had already been waiting for me in the control 
center of the spacecraft.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, are you ready? Let's start today's work right away!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't say anything but nodded to start. PETE didn't neglect it, and immediately turned on 
the projector and continued to explain: "Sir, we completed the study of the structure and 
characteristics of the atmosphere last time. Today we will have an in-depth study of the 
movement and function of the atmosphere."
    </p>
    <p>
        "We know that the atmosphere plays a vital role in the operation of the Earth, so how does 
it operate? And what role does it play for the earth?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I scratched my head and carefully recalled what the teacher said in class. Because I was a 
little uncertain, I could only whisper: "It seems that there is some insulation effect, and the 
heating process through solar radiation..."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Well, sir, although what you said is not very accurate, it is generally consistent!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Then it's my turn––
    </p>
    <p>
        ––In fact, the atmosphere has many effects on the earth. Today I will mainly talk about the 
process of atmospheric heating and the movement of the atmosphere."
    </p>
    <p>
        I nodded, and he began to explain: "I will start with the process of atmospheric heating. Sir, 
please take a look at this picture first!"</p>
    <p> After that, it immediately projected a "schematic 
diagram of atmospheric heating process" pointed to the picture, and asked me: "Sir, 
have you seen this picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I stared at the picture and shook my head, then said: "I haven't seen this one, but I have 
seen similar ones on the teacher's slides in class."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Okay, then this means that you should know these knowledge points, so I will continue!
    </p>
    <p>
        We all know that all physical processes in the atmosphere are accompanied by energy 
conversion. So, sir, do you know what is the main source of energy for the earth's 
atmosphere?"
    </p>
    <p>
        This time I finally got confident and answered immediately: "It is solar radiation!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, you got it right. It seems that you were not distracted in class!
    </p>
    <p>
        Then let me test you again. You can look at this picture or recall it first. My question is: How 
does solar radiation propagate? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought for a while, and answered a little stutteringly: "It should... It 
should first pass through the atmosphere. During the propagation process, part of it is 
absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere, and part of it reaches the surface of the Earth. 
That part will be absorbed or reflected by the ground, so the ground will warm up because 
of absorbing solar radiation, and at the same time, it will transfer the heat to the 
atmosphere near the ground. After the atmosphere near the ground absorbs it, it will be 
transmitted layer by layer. "
    </p>
    <p>
        After I finished speaking, I felt a little nervous, afraid that I might have expressed myself 
incorrectly or that there was something wrong with my logic. But I didn't expect that 
PETE would raise his slender mechanical arm, clench his palm, protrude his thumb, and 
give me a thumbs-up while showing his deep dimples.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, you are great. It seems that you have mastered this part of the content, and you also 
talked about the right half of the content, which means that you have basically absorbed 
what the teacher said in class! "PETE exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
        “But I still want to add to your point, sir. When the atmosphere warms up, it also radiates 
outward. Except for a small part that will be emitted upward into space, most of it will be 
emitted downward back to the ground. Because it is in the opposite direction of ground 
radiation, it is called <b>atmospheric counter radiation</b>.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Because it transfers heat to the ground, it compensates for some of the heat lost by the 
ground to a certain extent, so it has a certain role in keeping the ground warm. By the way, when there are clouds in the sky (especially dense low clouds), atmospheric counter radiation is stronger, as it will absorb or reflect some radiation again.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Okay, so I'll stop here on the basic content of the heating process. Next, I will talk about 
the movement of the atmosphere. Sir, I see that you are in very good condition today, so I 
will test you again: What are the two forms of atmospheric movement? "
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, it is horizontal movement and vertical movement!" </p>
    <p>"That's right, sir, what are the horizontal and vertical movements of the atmosphere?"</p>
    <p>
        "It's simple. Wind is the horizontal movement of the atmosphere, and thermal circulation is 
the vertical movement. What's the point of asking?" I replied contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Da..da!!! Well said, the first part is correct, but the latter part is wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Ah? How is it possible? I clearly remember that thermal circulation is vertical... Sir, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE interrupted my questioning, "Sir, don't be impatient, listen to my explanation first: the 
vertical movement of atmospheric movement is only a condition that leads to thermal 
circulation and the vertical movement of the atmosphere is not thermal circulation!”
    </p>
    <p>
        "Ah? It's not vertical movement, could it be horizontal movement?" I asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, this requires you to understand the definition of atmospheric thermal circulation: 
thermal circulation is the simplest form of atmospheric movement, and air circulation is 
formed due to uneven heat and cold on the ground. The formation process is as follows: 
the atmosphere in the heated area expands and rises, forming low pressure near the 
ground and high pressure in the high altitude; the opposite is true in the cold area, thus 
forming a <b>pressure difference</b> between the horizontal plane near the ground and the high 
altitude; and it promotes the horizontal movement of the atmosphere, forming a thermal 
circulation at high and low altitudes. At the same altitude in the sky, the weight of the air 
column per unit area (i.e., air pressure) is large in the hot area, and the air pressure is small 
in the cold area, forming a hot-cold airflow at high altitude. After the airflow in the hot area 
is lost, the entire air column is reduced, low pressure is formed on the ground, and high 
pressure is formed in the cold area, forming a cold-hot airflow near the ground. Together 
with the rising and sinking airflows, a thermal circulation is formed."
    </p>
    <p>
        After explaining, PETE projected a schematic diagram - I saw a hand-drawn picture in 
front of me, and he also asked: "Sir, looking at this hand-drawn picture, can you now 
determine what kind of movement it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I looked at the picture thoughtfully, and then replied: "Oh, it should be composed of 
horizontal and vertical movements, right? "
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE nodded and said delightedly: "Yes, sir, you are really smart. It seems that the doctor 
has a good vision. You will definitely make great contributions to us in the future!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I also smiled at it, thinking about its praise just now, and immediately realized that 
something was wrong: Who is the doctor? Why do you say that I can make contributions in 
the future? I was anxious and immediately asked him: "Wait, doctor? Who is the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE seemed to realize that he had said something wrong, and quickly explained: "Sir, it's 
okay, I didn't say anything, just pretend I didn't say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
        After listening to its explanation of itself, I felt a little uneasy and anxious: When did the 
robot evolve to this stage, and would it defend its words? But learning this is not terrible, 
what is terrible is that it has all the abilities and thoughts that humans can do, which can be 
said to be catastrophic for the future development of mankind!
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to find out the truth, I mustered up the courage to ask it: "PETE, just tell me, tell 
me all the truth about me that I don't know, I don't want you to keep it secret from me!"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE didn't answer me directly, but looked a little nervous, then leaned down slightly and 
apologized to me: "Sir, I'm very sorry, sorry for not telling you our purpose and my life 
experience, I didn't expect that it would have such a big impact on you after I let it slip, I'm 
sorry!"
    </p>
    <p>
        It bowed to me again, and when I was about to help it up, it began to tell itself: "I am the first 
popular science robot with human emotions and thoughts created by Dr. Thorne. The 
doctor you just asked about is Dr. Thorne who created me and gave me life. My main task is 
to cooperate with Dr. Thorne to find people with astronomical talents and interests, and to 
popularize some knowledge about astronomy. At the same time, this is also the purpose of 
finding you. After investigating you these days, I think you are a person with a great interest in astronomy. It seems that we have found the right person! "
    </p>
    <p>
        "So, the so-called space odyssey these days is actually to investigate me? "
    </p>
    <p>
        "No, sir, we just want to see if you meet our requirements. Next, we will definitely go to 
space and start our space journey!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "What if I don't meet your requirements? Then I will go home directly, and my space journey 
will be ruined? Isn't your space journey a shocking scam?" I asked perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        "No, we won't do that. Besides, doesn't your job meet our requirements?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I was so mad that I had to tern my head away. But when I thought about it, I was actually 
amused by a robot! I was a little surprised and felt a cold sweat coming out. I had to 
straighten my posture and pretend to be serious. I turned around and asked: "What about 
the so-called doctor you mentioned? Where is he? Why didn't you tell me in advance that 
you can test me?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "I'm sorry, sir, I forgot that I haven't introduced Dr. Thorne to you yet! He is very busy. 
Although he is 73 years old this year, he still stays in the laboratory every day. To be honest, 
he is actually an "academic madman"! "
    </p>
    <p>
        I was shocked by his ability to think like a human again, but I thought about it again. In this 
era of rapid development and rapid changes in robots, what can I do? I can only slowly 
adapt to its abilities and treat it as a true friend. I straightened my posture again and asked 
PETE a different question: "What's next? What do we do? Have we finished the content 
about the atmosphere?"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE smiled slightly, "Sir, don't forget that we only discussed the process of atmospheric 
heating. Isn't there a horizontal movement that we haven't discussed yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yes, I forgot where we stopped, but you can't do this. You hid such a big secret about me. 
Do you have my trust?"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE was like a little kid at this time. He made a face at me and then said, "Oh, I heard it, 
but you can't do this, sir. You ignore the reason why you can come here because of your 
own preferences. You have the same problem as Dr. Thorne. If we were not an academic 
team, you would be deceived!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Aren't you considered a liar for your behavior?" I questioned, rolling my eyes at him.
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE replied calmly: "Sir, calm down. The doctor and I are just a little anxious. Because 
there are few scientific and technological talents in recent years, we are in a hurry to 
achieve success. I hope you can understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Fair enough, I don't want to listen to your explanation anymore. Continue to discuss horizontal movement!"
    </p>
    <p>
        He nodded, then skillfully turned on the projector and began to explain: "This is a wind 
turbine. I remember that you said before that the horizontal movement of the atmosphere 
is wind, right? </p>
    <p>In fact, it is true that horizontal movement near the ground will form wind. In 
the meantime, air movement is generated under the action of forces. The forces acting on 
the air are gravity, pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, and ground friction. Near the 
ground, because the inertial centrifugal force is small and can be ignored, the wind is 
mainly affected by three forces: horizontal pressure gradient force, Coriolis force and 
friction. But before introducing the pressure gradient force, sir, I would like to ask you what 
is the pressure gradient. How is it generated?”
    </p>
    <p>
        "It seems that it is because the ground is heated unevenly, causing some air to rise and 
some air to sink, resulting in differences in air pressure on the same horizontal plane. The 
difference in air pressure per unit distance is the pressure gradient." I rejoindered.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Very good, then you should be able to understand what follows:
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Pressure Gradient Force</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        It is a vector that is perpendicular to the isobaric surface and points 
from high pressure to low pressure. Its value is equal to the pressure difference within a 
unit distance. Although the horizontal pressure gradient is small, it is the starting force that 
drives the air movement and is the direct cause and power of the horizontal movement of 
the air.
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Coriolis Force</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        While the air moves in the direction of the horizontal pressure gradient force on the rotating 
surface of the earth, it will be affected by the earth's rotational force. The Coriolis force 
values of different latitudes around the world are different. The Coriolis force on the 
equator is zero, the Coriolis force at the poles is the largest, and the Coriolis force at other 
latitudes is between the two. The direction of the Coriolis force points to the right of the 
object's movement in the northern hemisphere and to the left of the object's movement in 
the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis force is only generated when the air moves relative 
to the surface of the earth, and it only changes the direction of the air movement (wind 
direction) but not the speed of the air movement (wind speed).

    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Friction</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        Friction in atmospheric motion is generally divided into internal friction and external 
friction. Internal friction is a kind of restraining force generated between two air layers in 
contact with each other at different speeds or directions. Because of its small value, it is 
often not considered. External friction is the resistance of the underlying surface  to the 
movement of air when the air moves close to the <b>underlying surface</b>(<b>the interface between the atmosphere and the solid ground or liquid water surface below it</b>). Its direction is 
opposite to the direction of air movement. At the same time, friction can reduce the speed 
of air movement and reduce the Coriolis force accordingly. In terms of the influence of 
friction, its influence on air is most significant near the ground, and gradually decreases 
with the increase of altitude. Above 1km-2km, the influence of friction is so small that it 
can be ignored. Therefore, the area below this altitude is called the friction layer, and the 
area above is called the free atmosphere.

        "Oh, so that's the case. Then I would like to ask, what are the friction layer and the free 
atmosphere, and what are their respective functions?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Very good, sir! Although this is not the point I 
want to emphasize, you can think seriously and raise questions, so I will still give a brief 
answer:
    </p>
    <p><li><b><u style="color: rgb(98, 126, 248);">Friction Layer</u></b></li></p>
    <p>
        The friction layer is another name for the atmospheric boundary layer. It is at the bottom of 
the atmosphere. Because its thickness is related to many factors, it ranges from a few 
hundred meters to 1.5 to 2.0 kilometers, with an average of 1 kilometer. It is named 
because its movement state is obviously affected by the friction of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        The free atmosphere refers to the atmosphere far away from the ground and not affected by 
the friction of the ground. It usually refers to the atmosphere above 2000 meters. In the free 
atmosphere, due to the absence of friction, the movement of air is mainly affected by the 
pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. In the free atmosphere, air movement 
basically obeys the geostrophic wind (<b>where the horizontal movement of air in the free atmosphere when the horizontal pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force are balanced</b>) or gradient wind law , and the airflow is almost 
parallel to the isobars.

        “Sir, I will say so much about this part for now, because these are not very useful for what 
we will talk about in the future, so if you are interested in this aspect, we will discuss it 
together later!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Okay, I don’t have any questions, so what should we do next?”

        “Sir, next is the part you are most looking forward to!”

was increasing unconsciously, and it burst out at the moment of filling...
