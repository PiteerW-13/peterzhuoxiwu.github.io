    <h2>Act 1.4 - Breaking Out of the Earth!</h2>

    <p>
        <b style="font-size: larger;">Whoosh!</b></p>
    <p> The launch of the spacecraft this time is like an arrow from a bow: the bow bears huge 
resistance, and the stern gathers huge energy; with agility and lightning speed, it speeds 
towards the endless sky.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the spacecraft was in a stable stage, PETE finally started to speak: "Sir, guess where 
we are now?"</p>
    <p> "Where else can we be? We should be in space, right? Please open the porthole, I want to 
see the outside world!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, that's not right. Do you know why I deliberately didn't open the porthole curtain? That's 
because I wanted you to guess where we are, but you took a miss. We are still on Earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I widened my eyes and questioned PETE: "Ah? Isn't the spacecraft already in a state of 
equilibrium? And it has been flying for a while, shouldn't we be in outer space?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "No, sir, think about what we just finished --- the atmosphere. When we were discussing it, 
we already..."
    </p>
    <p>
       "Are we still in the atmosphere now?" I answered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yes, sir, we are still in the atmosphere. To be precise, we should be at the top of the 
stratosphere, about 54km high."
    </p>
    <p>
       "Ah? Why are we still in the stratosphere? This is the fastest spacecraft I have ever seen. At 
this speed, it should at least reach the inhomogeneous layer! "I was so anxious that I couldn't 
wait to rush into the unreachable space.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, it seems you don't know that going into space is not a joke. If the operation is not good, 
the spacecraft will be damaged at best, and the hull will be destroyed at worst, and we will 
die here!" 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a little arrogant at first, but when I heard that it was a life-gumbling game, I was also scared and broke 
into a cold sweat. I had to obey PETE's orders, sit in my original seat, and fasten my 
seat belt.
    </p>
    <p>
         When PETE saw me panicking, he started laughing like a little kid and said, "Haha, sir, don't 
be so nervous. Our spaceship seats have an automatic fixing function. Just sit in the seat 
and make sure it's stable. Besides, we haven't reached the place where we should fasten 
our seat belts yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
       I glanced at PETE and snorted, "I am following the safety rules. I will fasten my seat 
belts if I want to. Don't bother me!"
    </p>
    <p>
        PETE nodded and said, "Sir, you are right. I was just joking. Okay, back to the topic. We will 
leave the stratosphere and continue to climb upwards. By the way, the speed of the 
spaceship will increase. In fact, it is not wrong for you to fasten your seat belts earlier!" 
After that, it also sat in its seat and handed me a heavy and thick "coat" - a space suit.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir, put it on quickly. As the spaceship accelerates, the pressure will increase. Although 
the material of the spaceship can withstand huge pressure, but you will still feel 
uncomfortable!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I quickly put on the space suit. Before I could react to the heaviness of the "jacket", the 
spacecraft began to accelerate. As the spacecraft began to vibrate and tremble violently, a 
strong recoil followed, and the original thickness of the "jacket" made me feel like a gorilla 
pressing on me. </p>
    <p> Instantly, I was almost out of breath and had to use all my strength to meet 
my breathing needs. When I was about to press the button to call him, I found that my body 
seemed to be frozen and I could hardly lift my hands from the armrests of the seat. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At this time, his voice finally came from the sensor: "Sir, how are you? If you feel a little 
uncomfortable, please bear with it. We will rush out of the earth and reach outer space 
soon!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "I... I can't stand it anymore!" I gritted my teeth and said under the increasing pressure. Just 
when I was about to give up, the "gorilla" on my body seemed to be frightened and 
disappeared in an instant. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to ask where PETE was, but a feeling of dizziness came over me, and I felt dizzy and dizzy. When I squinted my eyes and tried to 
see the word "arrived" on the display, the dizziness came over me again. I was caught off 
guard, closed my eyes, and fell asleep...
