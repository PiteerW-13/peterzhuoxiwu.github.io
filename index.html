        <tr>
            <td><p> Hi here!!! I am Peter Zhuo Xi Wu, a first year Physics and Data Science student at Constructor University.
            I am originally from China. I am a dedicated explorer of the cosmos with a passion for unraveling the 
            mysteries of the universe. Academically, my research interest lies in compact objects and the influence 
            of the gravitational waves from astrophysics, as well as the computational skills needed to investigate 
            them.</p>

        <tr>
            <td><p> With a deep-rooted curiosity for all things celestial, I have spent years immersed in the study of
            astronomy and astrophysics, translating complex scientific concepts into accessible language for readers
            of all backgrounds. Now, I have bridged cultures and perspectives, drawing inspiration from diverse
            experiences and scientific communities worldwide. Beyond academic pursuits, I have been actively involved
            in fostering cross-cultural exchange, organizing events, and leading presentations to share my knowledge 
            and inspire others.</p>

            <td><p>In my personal writing, PETE-A Voyage Through the Space, I invite readers from the perspective of PETE to 
            journey through the cosmos, exploring everything from the birth of stars to the intricate dance of galaxies.
            So from now on, immerse yourself in the vastness of the universe, let’s follow PETE, traveling in space!</p>
